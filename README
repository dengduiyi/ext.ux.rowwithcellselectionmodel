Ext.ux.RowWithCellSelectionModel
================================

This Ext JS extension enables the user to activate the editor of an editable cell in an Ext.grid.EditorGridPanel
through a double click, to navigate through the cells via the cursor keys and select one or multiple rows through
the mouse or through the cursor keys, if no cell is currently selected.
In summary, this selection model is a combination of the two built-in selection models Ext.grid.RowSelectionModel
and Ext.grid.CellSelectionModel.
I created it out of the need to be able to add, edit and delete records in an EditorGridPanel. To delete one or
multiple records, the user needs to select one or multiple rows which is not possible when using the default
Ext.grid.CellSelectionModel.



Usage
=======

new Ext.grid.EditorGridPanel({
  ds: your_data_store,
  cm: your_column_model,
  sm: new Ext.ux.RowWithCellSelectionModel()
});



Alternatives
============

There exists another extension called Ext.ux.grid.RowAction by Jozef Sakalos, aka Saki, which enables you to add
icons with actions to grid rows. You can't delete multiple records at once, but it's worth a look. See http://rowactions.extjs.eu/
